# 42piscine

## Coding developed at 42saopaulo's C bootcamp - Piscine.

### About 42sp
42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers,
no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a
methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is free for whoever is
approved in its selection process. The so-called "C Piscine", a 26-day C programming bootcamp,
is the last stage in the selection process for becoming a "cadet".
